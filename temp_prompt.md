Read PLAN.md. We are currently on phase 1.

Please implement this step in P1_510.c.

Constraints:

If this step involves writing code, ensure you use the exact loop structures from docs/01_specifications.md. Do not change while to for or vice versa unless the spec allows it.

If the step involves testing, explain what command I should run to verify it (e.g., ps -a, ipcs, or compiling with gcc).

After implementing, mark the step as [x] in PLAN.md.
